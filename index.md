I am a student at CSUF attempting the insanity of triple majoring in Computer Science; Game Art, Animation and Immersive Media; and Entertainment Art/Animation.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6, Part 2
The reason why Lab 6, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs in this course was because of taking in a command argument from the console. This course is the first time I am using shell arguments and it was in both parts for Lab 6 we started to directly pull from the command_line. The reason I choose part 2 over part 1 is because of using and statements along with or statements in the function file.

Lab 8, Part 1
The reason why Lab 8, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs in this course was because of for-each loops. Even though I had previous coding experience, I have never seen or heard of for-each loops before. With Lab 8, specifically the first part it gave me the opportunity to actively learn how to implement for-each loops.

Lab 10, Part 1
The reason why Lab 10, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs in this course was because of two dimensional vectors. While having previous coding experience, even taking a class in C++, I have never used two dimensional vectors before. It was through this part of lab 10 that I was able to actively learn how to pop items from a two dimensional vector into a variable using for-each loops.
